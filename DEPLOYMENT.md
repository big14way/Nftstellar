## Deployment Process

1. Fixed build issues in the contract code
2. Built the contract with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`

4. Add additional features:
   - Collections
   - Bulk minting
   - Auction functionality
   - Enhanced metadata display

## Development Workflow

For further development:

1. Make changes to the contract code
2. Rebuild and optimize the contract
3. Deploy a new version of the contract
4. Update the frontend configuration with the new contract ID
